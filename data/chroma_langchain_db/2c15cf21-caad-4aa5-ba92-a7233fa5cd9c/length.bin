The ablation study highlights redundancy filtering’s key role in ChunkRAG, with dynamic chunk merging and optimal similarity thresholds (validated at _θ_ = 0 _._ 8 ) balancing chunk reduction and relevance while preventing over-filtering. Future work could investigate domain-specific thresholds for varying chunk granularity needs and incorporate computational efficiency metrics to assess scalab
